        Here we provide an example of the human CXCL12 chemokine. See the original page <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="/protein/CXCL12_HUMAN/" target="_blank" class="">here</a>.

    <h2 class="mt-3 mb-3 search-title">Protein information</h2>
    <p>
        The top section of the CXCL12 protein page gives an overview of general information including alternate names, organims and links to external databases (UniProt, Guide to Pharmacology) 
        as well as information in the corresponding UniProt record (ID, Organism, protein length).
    </p>
    <p>
        Then there is a representation of the canonical protein sequence of the specific entry. Ths horizontal scrollable table shows all amino acids, their generic numbers and is divided into
        the different structural segments (N-term, CXC, N-loop, B-sheet 1, 30s-loop, B-sheet 2, 40s-loop, B-sheet 3, 50s-loop, a-helix, and C-term)

    <p>
        Below that there is a chemokine diagram that contains a 2D depiction of the canonical residues with different sections named.
        This diagram is interactive and can be customized by the user. The code to generate this diagram is adapted from the GPCRdb snake plot and customized for chemokine representation.
